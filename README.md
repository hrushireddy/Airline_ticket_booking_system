# Airline Ticket Booking System

This project is a Java-based desktop application developed using **NetBeans IDE** for booking airline tickets. It features a GUI-based system that allows users to manage flight bookings, cancellations, payments, and more. The system connects to a **MySQL** database and uses additional external libraries for enhanced functionality.

## ðŸ“¦ External Libraries

The project uses the following libraries located in the `add jar folder/` directory:

- **jcalendar-1.4.jar** â€“ Used for calendar components in forms.
- **mysql-connector-java-5.1.23-bin.jar** â€“ JDBC driver for MySQL connectivity.
- **rs2xml.jar** â€“ Used for populating JTable components from ResultSets.

These JARs need to be added to your NetBeans project classpath.
